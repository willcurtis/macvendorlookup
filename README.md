# macvendorlookup
Basic script to lookup Vendors against a MAC address

A very basic script to lookup a MAC address against the https://macvendors.com database using their API. 

MAC addresses can be entered in a number of formats including 001122 or 00:11:22 or 00-11-22 and will return a manufacturer name providing it appears in their database.

UPDATE: If the MAC address is not found the script will now return a useful message stating the vendor is not found
