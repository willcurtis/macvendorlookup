Basic script to lookup Vendors against a MAC address

A very basic script to lookup a MAC address against the https://macvendors.com databse using their API. 

MAC addresses can be entered in a number of formats including 001122 or 00:11:22 or 00-11-22 and will return a manufacturer name providing it appears in their database.

Currently if the MAC address is not found it wont return a useful message unfortunately.
